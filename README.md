This project is a customizable E-commerce website that can be used to sell products online. NUWC wanted the website so they could sell Juice to employees on their bases that employess could order from their phone or desktop. However, NUWC also wanted the website to be highly customizable so that it could be used to sell different things in the future.

The website is highly customizable by an admin account as you can see here:

Employees accounts can see the current orders page and can delete orders once they have been picked up:
